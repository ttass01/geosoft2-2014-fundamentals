## Evaluation

The evaluation is conducted based on the content of the handout, the presentation itself, and the discussion afterwards during the course. Be prepared for questions by your fellow students and the teachers, but also prepare some drill-down topics or potential questions yourself so that you can stick to your presentation time slot.

## Topics

Make sure you cover at least the mentioned keywords. More is better, but only really better if you evaluate alternatives, phrase opinions, and provide guidelines for your fellow students.
